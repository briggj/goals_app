Goals! - Your Kickass Habit Tracker

What's This?

So you quit something awesome (or maybe not-so-awesome, like caffeine)? This little Python app helps you track how long it's been since you stopped.

It uses customtkinter so it doesn't look totally ancient, and it throws random motivational quotes at you to keep you going. Fair warning: some of the included quotes are inspired by Johnny Lawrence and might be a bit... intense (and explicit, 'cause why not?). Strike First!

Cool Stuff It Does:

    Track Your Wins: Keep tabs on up to 10 habits you've kicked to the curb.
    See Your Streak: Shows you exactly how long you've lasted (in years and days).
    Manage Your List: Add new goals, delete old ones (don't worry, it asks first!), and edit goals if you messed up the date or name.
    Easy Peasy GUI: Simple graphical interface that's easy to figure out.
    Calendar Picker: No more typing dates like a caveman! Uses tkcalendar for a pop-up calendar.
    Badass Motivation: Get a random quote for each goal. It sticks around for your whole session but changes next time you open the app. You can easily edit the list in the code to add your own gems!
    Make it Readable: Pick your own font size from a dropdown if the default text is too damn small.
    Remembers Your Stuff: Saves your goals (goals_data.json) and your chosen font size (settings.json) automatically, so you don't lose anything when you close it.
